Dido does not like Aeneas going away, but Aeneas feels it is his duty to go and found Rome, especially since he was told by the gods to do it.

In Wrecking Ball, Cyrus produces what sounds like a rant with more words. That rant is just expressing how she took the breakup (blindsided, just like Dido)."
